# Surf's Up--Module 9 Challenge
## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The narrative of this module follows a person who is wanting to open a small business in Hawaii.  He has created a report for investors to show the weather conditions in order to assure them of the favorable weather conditions around the location of the small business.  The report requested was for the weather data, requesting specifically the temperatures for the months of June and December.  

These numbers were found by using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to filter the temperatures for the months of June and December in the hawaii.sqlite database. A dataframe was then created from the database in order to gain summary statistics.

This information will be used in a report to potential investors to influence their decision to support the small business.
